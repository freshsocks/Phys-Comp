Arduino projects for Physical Computing class

I changed my final project a few times.

## In the beginning...

At first, I was going to use the johnny-five library to write my Arduino software using Javascript. I did it! But I'm not using that anymore because I'm doing stuff with MIDI now and I don't want to overcomplicate things

## After that...

I bought a BeagleBone Black and I was hacking around with that for a while. I wanted to make a piece of physical hardware that can control a webpage in the browser, and vice-versa. It's possible, I've seen it done, but I couldn't get everything installed on my BBB. Since I'm not a computer scientist, I gave up when I realized it woudl take me too much time just to get the board set up how I needed. Back to the Arduino...

## My final idea

My final idea is to make a MIDI controller using the Arduino. But not jsut any MIDI controller. This one controls tracks in Ableton Live with buttons. But not just any tracks & buttons. The buttons on my controller are **Album Covers** and the tracks are **Loops from the Albums**. The album cover buttons are on the floor and you step on them to DJ and remix the albums together.
